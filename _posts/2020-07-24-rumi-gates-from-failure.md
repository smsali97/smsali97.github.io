There is this saying called the **Three Gates of Speech** which has always inspired me. It is often attributed to the Sufi scholar *Rumi* and goes something like this:
> Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates: At the first gate, ask yourself **“Is is true?”** At the second gate ask, **“Is it necessary?”** At the third gate ask, **“Is it kind?”**

I think we should always have procedural and documented ways of handling tasks, the SOPs of our behavior! We have all seen the damage speeches can cause if left unfettered! People can use these to rouse hoards of people to a mob-like mentality and while on the other end of the spectrum politicians can go about twisting and turning their words like _ as they please because they know they are no consequences.

Similarly, I believe we should also be handling issues like failure. If a person has no code to adhere to when facing failure, it can lead to repeated cases of falling in the same pitfalls and if taken too deeply it can lead people to a downward spiral of depression. I have proposed a similar three gate structure to handling failure. These steps are not exhaustive and certainly not set in stone but should be enough for a general blueprint.

It goes like this, whenever you encounter failure ask yourself these three questions:

1. Is it recoverable?
2. Could you have done something about it?
3. Have you learnt something from it?

For each of these checkpoints there are corresponding actions you must take;
## Gate #1: Recovery.
Do not leave until all holes have been plugged and the worst of the storm is over.

The halting phase in the diagram is the most important, we need to let some passage of time to happen before we start jumping to conclusions. Otherwise, all we have is prejudiced premature responses not backed by reason or rationale which leads to a whole lot of pointing fingers and minimal learning, if at all. The best example here is that whenever you receive an angry email we have always found that rather than writing an instantaneous rash reply (which you end up regretting letter), it is much better to have a sleep on it.
## Gate #2 Cause.
Once the storm has been weathered, and time has passed, it is time to debrief. It is crucial for us to first ask the question before we start attributing fault , that was there something that could have been done? If a natural disaster wrecks your entire home, you could have taken safety precautions, but sometimes things happen that are out of your locus of control. The sooner we can acclimatize us with that , the better.
And then we need to adopt a strategy that I'd like to bundle together retrospection and introspection, we need to look in the past and see what happened. Aircraft investigations are perhaps the best examples of this as investigators try to turn back in time and see what went wrong and more importantly can such issues be reproduced and if so how can we stop them from happening as soon as possible. Most companies and people often have dedicated processes set aside for such steps.
