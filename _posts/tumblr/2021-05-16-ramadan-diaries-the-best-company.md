I imagine myself siting outside a marquee in Jannah; the grandest mehfils of them all! In the faint distance I can hear the sweet recitation of Hz. Dawud (AS) in the background, which is joined by the birds and animals. As I step closer to the source, I can feel the radiance of Nur envelop me and a rush of joy overwhelms me! I find myself a corner to sit in and just try to watch the majestic display from afar.Nearby, I see the Ghazis of Badr gathered around a bonfire sharing their war stories with the Muslims.I then see the brave Hz. Ali (RA) walking with the Sahabah brandishing his double-bladed sword as he retells the stories of Khyber to the Sahaba. And just besides him, I catch a glimpse of Hz. Umar (RA). taken aback by the magnanimous aura of awe and fear he exudes. And then there is Hz. Uthman (RA) as well! with his handsome appearance, humble as always, the Dhun Nurayn! And then you find Hz Abu Bakr (RA), the best friend of your Habib (SAW), you wish to come closer to him, and want to hear all the incidents of all the joys and sorrows he shared with him from start to finish.And then finally amidst all the crowd, you finally see him. your beloved Nabi (SAW). His blessed back is facing to all the choice Sahabas, martyrs and greeting them with open arms. Your heart is aching just to catch a look of his shining face, but then your heart skips a beat. Tears well up. &nbsp;When his eyes fall upon you, will he recognize you as His Ummati and give a radiant smile or will he be dismayed, and turn away. You want to apologize, you want to run to him into his arms and cry and ask for his blessings. But then something amazing happens… The Curtain opens.Allah (SWT) reveals Himself with All His Glory and Majesty and a wave of contentment takes over you and there is nothing more you could ever ask for and it looks like finally you found peace… at last.  

`“And he who obeys Allah and the Messenger -they shall be with those whom &nbsp;Allah has favoured -the Prophets, those steadfast in truthfulness1, the martyrs, and the righteous.” How excellent will they be for companions!“ [4:69]`

> This thought experiment is of what it might be like to be part of the best of companies! The Sahabah, Nabiyun we hear are not simply chapters in our stories but were living breathing personalities and just imagine how awesome it would be if we could meet them in Jannah! Imagine if you get to meet the friend of Allah (SWT) - Ibrahim (AS) for a day, the mighty Musa (AS) ? or the shining Yousuf (AS)?Assalaatualanabi Wassalaamualarasul Walambiyaa-il-mursaleen Kulluhum mukramoon!
