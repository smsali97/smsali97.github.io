What is the crime of innocence? The price of retribution? The consequence of ignorance?

The streets of Aleppo burned yesterday. A dozen people killed. At least that’s what the headlines say. A bundle of joyful youth reduced to a mere statistic. Its tragic how our life can be degraded and tossed around as figures for them to play with as they crunch the numbers behind their desks comparing the losses as if the twinkle in the eye of the dying infant can ever be represented by sound bites and characters of the English alphabet.

Wars leave behind two things. The rubble, and the innocent. The debris will be picked up by the victors, but who will pick up the wailing child? &nbsp;What words could possibly console the orphaned? Our words can simply assuage our grief, and give us some hope to sleep at night. For we truly did not know grief until we saw Aylan Kurdi’s body washed down the shore. For we truly did not know loss until we saw the Refugee camps.

We blame Bashar ul Assad and the Free Syrian Army for the bloodshed. And rightly so, our actions are not the ones that have led to deleterious consequences. But we fail to realize that while we may not be in the battlegrounds, our hands are bloodied all the same. &nbsp;So I pray, as the Ummah bleeds leaving behind the gaping wounds left by its aggressors. I pray that our hearts soften so they can hear the muffled sobs of the crying girl. And in the actions of theirs we change ourselves; so that maybe, just maybe, for once our words do not become hopeless exercises in futility but the spark of a nation united by blood, loss and tragedy. So that on that day when the murdered child will ask to the Almighty, “For what crime was she killed?” and our hearts welled with tears will not have the deafening silence to offer in reprieve.

_Do not weep for the children of Syria._

_Weep for our sake._
