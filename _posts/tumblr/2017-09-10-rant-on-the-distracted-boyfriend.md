I thought much like most of the stuff on the internet, this too would fade away. But I feel at least I on a personal level cannot let this go. You might argue, that this meme is intended for humor and must be taken casually. And for some, I might be even blowing this issue ‘out of proportion’.  
But the implicit message it portrays and hence somewhat acknowledges is what troubles me. This picture is essentially about comparison. When the sum total of a woman’s worth is put on a scale and compared to another solely on the criteria of what kind of reactions it can evoke from the crowd, how many 'heads can turn’, then you know there is a problem in society.  
But that’s not why I’m writing.   
Its about the man. Staring at a woman in any culture, norm or religion is considered rude and inappropriate. And staring with another woman present, is not only derogatory but is an insulting demeanor to the woman you’re with. Indirectly hinting at the inadequacy of a woman to be capable of being 'worthy’ of a man’s attention. This is the same mentality of a man who whistles and hoots at women in public. This is the same patriarchal mentality..the same pervasive gazes that can make a woman feel uncomfortable in a workplace or in another setting. It is not those 'looks of admiration’ she deserves, but it is _Respect_ she demands.
