> The metrics kept on changing.&nbsp;  
> First I was a letter of the English Alphabet.  
> Then, reduced to 4.00 digits.  
> Then, summed up to a six figure salary.  
> Then, measured in acres of land.  
> Then, assessed on my progeny.  
> Then, Nothing.  
> Little did they know that the only  
> constant was character.
