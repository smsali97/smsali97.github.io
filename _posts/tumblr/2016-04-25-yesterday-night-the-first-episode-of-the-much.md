Yesterday night, the first episode of the much highly awaited series Game of Thrones aired and I was just one of the myriad of people who eagerly anticipated its release since over a year (being an avid fan as I was of both   
the book series and the HBO show as well.) Engrossed as I was, and evidently aware of the TV pop-culture that is so deeply inherent in our society (as suggested by my Facebook Timeline) this was perhaps the best show I would ever watch in my lifetime. Intrigued character developments intricately tied with plot twists with awesome action and battle sequences of dragons, white-walkers and whatnot.

Despite all that was on offer, I deeply knew what I was watching is morally incorrect. The ideas of profanity, violence and most importantly vulgarity it inculcated in me certainly was detrimental to most if not all of the values that were held to me dearly. The barbaric mindset which echoed the patriarchal elements that is so evidently portrayed of female subjugation and is so reminiscent of the _Jahaliyat_ that was present in my Prophet’s (SAW) time.

Sure enough, my conscience and my weak super-ego started waging a war within me, falsely convincing myself, that I will only watch the ‘censored-version’- or better yet -’eyes-closed’ fast-forwarding when those 'parts’ would arrive , falsely deluding myself that it was just delaying the inevitable. After all, when everyone was doing it, why should I miss out on all the fun? People flock to this show in numbers and a fictitious tv show couldn’t possibly dictate my principles on life? I did not realize it at that moment…but I had never been so wrong in my life.

So yes I might miss on all the action Westeros has to offer, and I will be tempted to watch _just_ the next episode when it will air in the next few weeks. I know for sure that if I intend to leave this show, it will lead up to something better insha'Allah, for patience is an act that is duly rewarded and given its due compensation much many times manifold—and yes it’s definitely worth the wait. (Which I believe many GOT fans can affiliate with.)  
Because indeed He is the Best of Planners.  
For verily,   
“Whoever abandons something for the sake of Allah,  
He will replace it for him with something better than it”
