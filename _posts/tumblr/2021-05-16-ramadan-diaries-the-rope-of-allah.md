I once got lost into the supermarket, &nbsp;searching frantically for my mother who was just next to me, moments ago. Something had caught my eye on the other aisle, and unknowingly my hand slipped from hers and found myself lost in a labyrinth of rows.  
I donâ€™t remember being found, but I do know the inexplicable feeling I felt when I found her back, I held her hand ever-so firmly this time, never wanting to let go.   
  
Ramadan, to me, is much like the same. Each year I enter with a state of complete confusion and internal chaos. A boy who has lost its way into the supermarket once again. I find myself having let go the rope of Allah (SWT) and Ramadan is the place where I find it back again. Unsurprisingly, it is always where I left it. It is a temporary retreat for me to strengthen my grip and prepare for the testing walk ahead! The aisles of the dunya suddenly seem so meaningless and unattractive and all I ever wish for is to never let go again.&nbsp;
