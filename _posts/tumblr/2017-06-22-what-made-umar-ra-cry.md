excerpt: A man whose stance on religion was so firm, whose acceptance to Islam sent ripples of fear to his enemies so much so that even _Shaytaan_ used to acquire a different path than the one Umar (RA) had chosen. You would wonder what possibly could have been the reasons that would have reduced the mighty Hazrat Umar (RA) with his towering personality to tears?

A man whose stance on religion was so firm, whose acceptance to Islam sent ripples of fear to his enemies so much so that even _Shaytaan_ used to acquire a different path than the one _Umar (RA)_had chosen.

You would wonder what possibly could have been the reasons that would have reduced the mighty _Hazrat Umar (RA)_with his towering personality to tears?

## The Verse of God:

Once Hz. Umar (RA) was leading the _Fajr_prayer, and recited the following verse:

_He said, “I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah (12:86)_

Upon reciting this, he cried so much that his sobbing could be even heard among the last row of worshipers. This verse is from _Surah Yusuf_, of _Yaqub’s_(AS) response, who despite after the trials he went through was informed that another of his sons had been lost from him,.

Such was the Imaan of the believers who while reciting verses would cry out profusely. These are the same verses being recited today, but rarely do they leave such a deep mark as they did to the Sahaba.

## On Eid:

It seems ironic doesn’t it? On an joyous ocasion where people shed tears of joy to celebrate, Hz. Umar was found in moments of sorrow. It is said that on the day of the festival after the _Eid Salah_,_Hazrat Umar_ was searched. _Hazrat Umar (RA)_ who was the _Khalifa_ at that time was found sitting in a corner and crying so much so that his blessed beard was soaked wet. When asked he replied,

“How can a person who does not know if his fasts have been accepted celebrate Eid?”

A man of such calibre had a fear of his acceptance of his fasts? Here is a man whom the Prophet (SAW) himself said that if there were to be a prophet after me, indeed he would be _Umar (RA)_. Where do we stand?

## Visit to the Prophet’s (SAW) house&nbsp;   

One day Umar (RA)&nbsp; came into the house of the Prophet (SAW) to find him lying on a simple mattress which left its marks on his body. The Prophet (SAW) had only one sheet of cloth round him to cover the lower part of his blessed body. There was one simple bed with one pillow filled with nut fiber. On one side of the room was some barley and in one corner near his feet was an animal skin. There were some water-skins hanging beside his bed. `

Seeing this, _Hazrat Umar (RA)_ started to sob.

_“Why are you crying, O Umar”_, said the Prophet (SAW) .

”_O Allah’s Messenger ! Why shouldn’t I cry! The strings of the bed have left marks on your body. This is a small room with all your furniture, I can see what there is. The Byzantine Emperor and the Persian Emperor enjoy luxurious living while you, the Messenger of Allaah and the Chosen One, live like this.“&nbsp;_

He said, _"Ibn al-Khattab! Don’t you like that they choose this world and we choose the Hereafter?”_

* * *

The Sahaba never used to cry for worldly tribulations which were both transient and trivial in nature. Their cries were for their _Imaan,_ the_Ummah_ and Al-Akhirah. I have often found myself shedding a tear at an emotional episode of a TV sitcom, or an engaging sports match or perhaps even something more insignificant. Our tears, much like our time are scarce in number. We must decide where to spend these few tears. For if a drop can extinguish the bottomless pits of _Jahannum_ , and earn the Mercy of our _Rabb_, then surely they should be used for a worthy cause.

But today, it is difficult to cry. With the media having desensitized our emotions, no longer do the orphaned children in Syria and Iraq bring us to tears. Ignorance is bliss. It all does seem so distant, when in fact it is so near. However, that shouldn’t never suffice to be the excuse why. In fact it was Hz. _Umar (RA)_ who once after the Battle of _Badr_ saw the Prophet (SAW) and Hz. _Abu Bakr (RA)_ in a state of tears, and asked what is the reason.

And said, _“Tell me what makes you and Abu Bakr cry? If I find the reason for your crying convincing, I will cry like you and if not, I shall try to pretend crying.”_ I pray that today our hearts soften, and well up in the remembrance of Allah (SWT) in admiration and awe of his presence. _Allahumma Ameen!_
