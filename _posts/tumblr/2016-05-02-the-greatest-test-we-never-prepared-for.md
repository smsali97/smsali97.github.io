Many of us received our results of Cambridge International Examinations similar to the format of this yesterday. These results were that which seemed final but were never fatal, and could not have possibly dictated our entire future, and may be of little or no use in the later years.

But what if I told you there is a result that does exactly the above, and we are all currently in the process of its examination. It is the examination of life. A regular candidate would be disappointed to receive these results in the CIE let alone on an examination that governs everything with his/her entire future at stake. And picture yourself receiving this result in front of your Lord, whose love for you supersedes that of a mother’s much many times manifold. And to disappoint Him when He was the one who fashioned you, guided you, and all that He asked was His remembrance so that He would remember you too in return. And then also imagine, your role model and mentor looking down at you at a distance, your _Nabi_ (SAW) realizing you as a part of his _Ummah_ ready to intercede for you but you failed him and his discontent is apparent in his blessed face which is the last thing you ever wished to see.

And just for a fleeting moment, imagine you are actually receiving such results on the Day of Judgement.

But forgive me but that’s supposed to be hardly surprising, no? I mean so to speak, for a people who seem to ace A levels exams with flying colors in roughly two years , our result in an examination that encompassed our entire lifetime just falls a tad below the margin. I mean, we had centuries worth of past papers in front of us, waiting to be examined, now left barely touched. We saw real life examiner reports of civilizations that were reduced to dust because they forgot their purpose. On the flipside, we also did see accounts of the lives of the Outstanding Learners in the cities of Medina, Baghdad and Constantinople lauded with distinctions and accolades.

We also cannot say the paper was way beyond our capabilities. For Allah had even lowered our grade thresholds to its minimum. No extraordinary expectations were required from us, each person to do as much as possible within his domain. Our Rabb even reduced our prayers to a bare minimum of five and no burden was placed more than our shoulders could bear.

Similarly, we cannot complain we ran out of time, with the duration of a lifetime to find our _Rabb_; when only a momentary whisper in _Sujood_ could please Him. We cannot say it came out of our syllabus. We knew the questions, and we even knew the answers! Answers metamorphosed in the form of the Companions and our beloved Prophet (SAW) who acted it out in front of us and gave us a practical demonstration of how it’s done.

We cannot say we did not know. We knew each step’s destination that dragged us into the potholes deep within just to fall at the doorstep of _Ar-Rahman_ who was ready with His Mercy to forgive us once more. We were warned of the fire countless times, and lured by the attractions that surrounded it, we drew in it each time, only to find our hands scarred and burnt. And finally, with these sinner’s hands when we finally decided to raise it in supplication it was too late. The soul had left, the exam finished and all that remained was a vessel of a hollow body which had thought it had all the time in the world.

And thats it. The finality of the situation. No rechecks, for the judge is _Al-Adl_. No retakes, for the commands of _Al-Jalil_ are final. No reattempts, for _Al-Mu’akhkhir_ had given us many chances. And now what remains is a deed of accounts in our left hand, opened by the spine with its contents spilling as a painful reminder of a life in a former world; and a letter reading that our admission in _Jannat_ is rescinded; and a person dragged by the angels as the fire envelops him in a spiral of fury and blaze.

Aside: Congratulations to those who were tested in moments of Shukr and even more congratulations to those who were tested in moments of Sabr, Khair Insha’Allah! ^.^
